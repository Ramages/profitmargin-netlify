# profitmargin-netlify
A site to display the profit margin of American stock companies

This project servers a dual purpouse, it helps me learn react, and I get an overview of the financials of the companies on the American stock market

Disclamer: This site contains no financial advice, this is just information, all actions are left to the individual using the site.
